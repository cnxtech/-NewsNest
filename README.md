#NewsNest
NewsNest (goo.gl/UW7gib) lets you search for a Twitter “hashtag” (#) and visualizes a heat map of the #’s frequency across the contiguous United States, a list of relating news articles, and up to 100 of the most recent tweets that used the Hashtag.

Individual tweets in the resulting list may appear highlighted in red or green representing the general sentiment of the tweet. If green, the tweet is recognized as having a positive outlook, whereas red is indicative of anger, depression, or other generally negative emotions. 
The news articles appearing on the left-hand side of the webpage collected from Google. 
The heat map (powered by Bing) is a visual representation of the popularity of the searched tag, with red representing a very high usage and purple representing the lowest grade of usage provided the tag is used at least once.
